<h1>1)    Gaussian Mixture Modeling</h1>

The company you work for has a client who <u>insists that</u> <u>all delivered code is extensively documented</u>. Your boss has an implementation of Gaussian mixture modeling that she wants to integrate into the final product, but it <u>does not contain a single comment describing the</u> <u>functionality of the code</u>. It is well known around the office that you are knowledgeable about the theory of Gaussian mixture modelling, so you have been given the job to thoroughly document the uncommented code.




<ul>

 <li>Starting from the attached code for Gaussian mixture modeling, comment and document the code to bring it up the high standards of the client. <u>Be thorough, and reference relevant equations and the EM</u> <u>algorithm</u>. <u>Include the commented code in the appendix.</u></li>

 <li>The client also wants the option to have a hard clustering/labeling. In your report, describe a method (of your choice) to use the output of the Gaussian mixture model to assign hard class labels to every data point. <u>Implement your method and <strong>show and discuss</strong> the results on random data generated by the</u> <u>code (by showing a plot of data points colored by class/cluster like the figure above)</u>.</li>

</ul>

<h1>2)    Deformable Contour Segmentation</h1>

<strong> </strong>

Implement deformable contour segmentation based on the following algorithm. A couple of hints:




<ul>

 <li>While working on your implementation, you can test with the included ‘<em>png’</em> which represents an ideal image with strong edges and no noise.</li>

 <li><u>You can immediately update the snake point Pi you are working on</u>, there is no need to keep a copy and update all at once.</li>

 <li><u>Don’t forget to Gaussian blur</u> before computing the gradients for generating the gradient magnitude Eimage. The amount of blurring may have an impact on your results.</li>

 <li>Think about how you want to handle the relationship between P1 and PN. In other words, what do Pi-1 and Pi+1 mean in these cases?</li>

</ul>

<u>You can initialize the snake in any way of your choosing</u>, with mouse clicks for example if you prefer. You can also initialize with a sampled circle:




<strong>def</strong> create_snake(center_x, center_y, radius, num_pts):

samples <strong>=</strong> np.linspace(0, 2<strong>*</strong>math.pi, num_pts)     snake <strong>=</strong> np.zeros((num_pts,2))

snake[:,0] <strong>=</strong> np.round(radius <strong>*</strong> np.cos(samples) <strong>+</strong> center_x)     snake[:,1] <strong>=</strong> np.round(radius <strong>*</strong> np.sin(samples) <strong>+</strong> center_y)




<strong>return</strong> snake




In your report, address the following:




<ul>

 <li>Using the attached image ‘<em>png’</em>, <u>find parameter</u> <u>settings which succeed</u> to segment the implied contour, and also <u>find</u> <u>parameter settings which fail</u>.

  <ul>

   <li>Include an analysis of the parameter settings. Why did they lead to failure or success?</li>

   <li>Include images of the final segmentations shown with the original image, like the figure on the right.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Using the attached image ‘<em>png’</em>, present your best results using: o An initialization with 10 snake points o An initialization with 30 snake points o An initialization with 500 snake points o <u>Show all results and discuss what you observe</u>.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Using the attached image ‘<em>png</em>’, show your best result in segmenting the head and hair (as in the figure on the right). <u>Discuss your process for finding the parameters which gave your</u> <u>best result.</u></li>

</ul>

<h1>3)  Parallel Stereo Cameras</h1>

<strong> </strong>

Consider a <u>parallel camera</u> setup with identical cameras separated by 300 mm. Each camera has a focal length <u>measured in pixels</u> of 4300 pixels. This roughly corresponds to a camera with a width of 4032 pixels and a field of view of ~50 degrees, corresponding to a focal length of ~50 mm. <strong><u>You will use focal length in pixels</u> <u>for this exercise.</u></strong>




<ul>

 <li>Plot disparity (x-axis) vs depth Z (y-axis) with disparity in the range [0, 200] pixels and Z in the range [0.001, 500000] mm. Use a plotting program rather than a hand drawn sketch.</li>

 <li>Generate two additional plots, with disparity in the range [0, 50] and disparity in the range [0, 20], but keeping Z fixed in the range [0.001, 500000] mm (also limit the axes to these values).</li>

 <li><u>In all 3 plots, label the x and y axis and include units.</u></li>

 <li>Describe the <u>shape</u> of the plot. With the shape of the plot and the disparity equation in mind, describe the relationship between disparity and depth Z.</li>

</ul>
